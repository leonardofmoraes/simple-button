# Simple Button Click Project

This is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that demonstrates simple button interaction. 

## How it Works

- **HTML:** The `index.html` file sets up the structure with a button and a paragraph element.
- **CSS:** The `style.css` file styles the button and centers it on the page.
- **JavaScript:** The `script.js` file handles the button click event:
  - Selects the button and paragraph elements.
  - Increments a counter variable each time the button is clicked.
  - Updates the paragraph content to display the click count.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the button to see the click counter in action!

## Purpose

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to:

- Create a simple webpage with HTML.
- Add basic styling with CSS.
- Use JavaScript to handle user interactions (button clicks).
- Dynamically update page content based on user actions.
